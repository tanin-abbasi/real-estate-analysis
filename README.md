# real-estate-analysis

This project analyzes real estate data and predicts property prices using machine learning algorithms.

##  Libraries Used
- 'pandas' , 'numpy' : Data handling and numerical computations
- 'matplotlib', 'seaborn' : Data visualization
- 'scikit-learn' : Machine learning models and evaluation
- 'joblib' : Saving trained models

## Features
- Data exploration and visualization
- Handling missing values and preprocessing
- Feature engineering for property data
- Training regression models for price prediction
- Saving trained models for future use

  ## Algorithm Implemented
- Linear Regression  
- Decision Tree Regressor  
- Random Forest Regressor  
- (Optional) K-Nearest Neighbors Regressor  

## Dataset
The dataset contains property features (location, size, rooms, etc.) and prices.  

## How to Run
1. Install required libraries  
2. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script  
3. Train models and predict property prices
